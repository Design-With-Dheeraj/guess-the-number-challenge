ðŸ˜Ž As a web developer, I recently created a "Guess the Number" challenge using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges users to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range, providing hints and feedback along the way. This project demonstrates my skills in developing interactive web applications that engage and challenge users. By using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I was able to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that enhances the user experience.
